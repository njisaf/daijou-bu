# Initial Nomic Ruleset

This file contains the **canonical starting rules** from Peter Suber’s original 1982 design of *Nomic*, divided into Immutable (100‑series) and Mutable (200‑series) rules.  
They are provided verbatim except for minor typographic cleanup (e.g., smart quotes → straight quotes, section headings, Markdown formatting).

---

## Immutable Rules (100‑series)

### 101 — Players
All people are potential players of Nomic. A player is a person who is taking his or her turn.

### 102 — Points and Victory
Initially each player has zero points. A player wins when their score reaches 100 (one hundred) points.

### 103 — Turn Sequence
Play proceeds in rounds. At the start of a round, the *Active Player* is the player whose turn it is. Each round consists of two phases:
1. **Proposal Phase** — The Active Player may propose one rule‑change.
2. **Voting Phase** — All players vote FOR or AGAINST the proposal.

### 104 — Order of Play
Players shall take turns in the alphabetical order of their full names, cycling indefinitely.

### 105 — Adoption of Proposals
A proposal is adopted and its rule‑change takes effect at the end of the round if and only if a majority (more than half) of the eligible votes are cast FOR it.

### 106 — Scoring
When a proposal is adopted, the player who proposed it gains 10 (ten) points, plus 5 (five) additional points for every player who voted FOR the proposal.

### 107 — Judge
The proposer of an adopted rule‑change becomes the Judge for the next round. The Judge adjudicates any disagreements about the legality or interpretation of rule‑changes.

### 108 — Timing of Rule‑Changes
No rule‑change takes effect before the end of the round in which it is adopted.

### 109 — Immutable and Mutable Rules
Rules in the 100‑series are *Immutable*; rules in the 200‑series are *Mutable*. Immutable rules take precedence over Mutable rules.

### 110 — Mutation
A rule‑change that adds, removes, or changes text in a rule may designate that rule as Mutable or Immutable.

### 111 — Repeal of Rules
Any Mutable rule may be repealed or amended by a rule‑change. Immutable rules may only be transmuted to Mutable before they can be repealed or amended.

### 112 — Permissibility
Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the rules is permitted and unregulated, and any player may act at their own discretion.

### 113 — Precedence
If two rules conflict, the one with the lower number has higher precedence.

### 114 — Rule‑Change Legality
Only actions explicitly permitted by the rules constitute valid rule‑changes.

### 115 — Rule Consistency
If adopting a rule‑change would cause a contradiction or inconsistency within the rules as a whole, the rule‑change is void and no effect occurs.

### 116 — Binding Text
The text of the rules and rule‑changes is binding and authoritative.

## Mutable Rules (200‑series)

### 201 — Proposal Format
A proposal must consist of a single rule‑change stated clearly and unambiguously.

### 202 — Voting Options
Each player’s vote must be either FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.

### 203 — Quorum
Quorum for voting is any number of players numbering at least half of the current players, rounded down.

### 204 — Vote Deadline
All votes must be cast within 24 hours of the end of the Proposal Phase; otherwise a player’s vote defaults to ABSTAIN.

### 205 — Tie‑Breaker
If a vote is tied FOR and AGAINST, the Judge’s vote breaks the tie. If the Judge already voted, their vote counts double.

### 206 — Score Penalty
Any player who fails to vote incurs a penalty of ‑10 (minus ten) points.

### 207 — Freeze Proposal
Any player may submit a *Freeze Proposal*; if adopted by unanimous vote, the game ends immediately.

### 208 — Bankruptcy
If a player’s score becomes negative, that player’s score is reset to zero.

### 209 — Transmutation Procedure
A proposal may *transmute* a rule by changing its status from Immutable to Mutable or vice‑versa; transmuting an Immutable rule to Mutable requires a ⅔ majority.

### 210 — Rule Numbering
New rules receive the lowest positive integer not currently used by an existing rule of the same series.

### 211 — Random Determination
If a rule requires random selection, the Judge shall use a method whose results can be verified by all players.

### 212 — Victory Update
Upon a player’s victory, the game resets: all players’ scores return to zero and all Mutable rules with numbers ≥300 are repealed.

### 213 — Amendment Threshold
Amending a rule requires a number of FOR votes greater than the number of AGAINST votes by at least two.
